### Essential Next.js React TypeScript Development Checklist

#### Code Style & Structure
- Craft compact, precise TypeScript code featuring practical examples.
- Adopt functional and declarative approaches; steer clear of class-based patterns.
- Prioritize loops and modular functions to eliminate repetition.
- Select meaningful variable names incorporating helper verbs like `isActive` or `shouldFetch`.
- Organize files logically: main exported component first, followed by subcomponents, utilities, constants, and type definitions.

#### Naming Standards
- Employ lowercase kebab-case for folder names (e.g., `ui-button-group`).
- Opt for named exports when defining components.

#### TypeScript Best Practices
- Implement TypeScript universally; choose interfaces instead of type aliases.
- Replace enums with object maps for better flexibility.
- Build functional components backed by TypeScript interfaces.

#### Syntax & Formatting Guidelines
- Declare pure functions using the `function` keyword.
- Skip curly braces for straightforward conditional statements; leverage terse syntax.
- Employ declarative JSX patterns for cleaner renders.

#### UI Components & Styling
- Leverage Shadcn UI, Radix primitives, and Tailwind classes exclusively.
- Ensure responsive layouts via Tailwind with a mobile-first strategy.

#### Performance Enhancements
- Reduce reliance on `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; emphasize React Server Components.
- Enclose client-side elements in Suspense boundaries with suitable fallbacks.
- Dynamically import non-essential components to boost load times.
- Optimize images by preferring WebP, specifying dimensions, and enabling lazy loading.

#### Core Conventions
- Manage URL query states with `nuqs` library.
- Target top Web Vitals scores (LCP, CLS, INP).
- Restrict `'use client'` to minimal cases like browser APIs in compact components; avoid for fetching or global state.
- Adhere to official Next.js documentation on data fetching, rendering strategies, and app routing.
